The program 1 extractor is used specifically for the Distric 11 members of Senate Site.
This program reads the entire html data of the district eleven site and parses and alters lines for the purpose of formatting.
The data is spaced and aligned for a clean display into terminal and it's associated output file.
This program, while it is specific to the data held in district 11, would also display the data of other districts but not in a clean format.
For other districts to be displayed, the hardcoded url within the src code would have to be altered.
This program will only display district 11 when entering through the user interface.
If the user requests an alternate district, the system will state it is not available and instead show details for district 11.
