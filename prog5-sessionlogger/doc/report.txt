Program 5 is a development from program 2, 3 and 4
Program 4 allows the user to exchange greetings and give more specific information
The program has been divided into 2 classes. The main class (prog5) handles user inputs while the format class collects the web information for formatting
This is done through object orientation where an instance of the format class is created when the user selects a District.
The format class has an outstanding array list to be printed at the end of the program.
The format class consistently recieves the user input and lines to be formatted from the main class.
Upon selection of the district, the most current information is pulled for the user to query.
All information is passed through an array list and printed to the data/output.txt file upon ending the program.
The User input is paresed by spaces to determine every word in the search. Each one of these words is compared to a key search term.
If a user input word matches a key search term by 70% or more then the user input will be converted to the key search and handled accordingly.
If there is no search term that adiquately matches then the user will be prompted to enter another search.
There is now a session logger. It hold all sessions that have passed through the terminal.
This is accessed through ARGUMENTS. The program will continue to run after addressing the argument.
chat sessions can be read as well as statistics from them.
