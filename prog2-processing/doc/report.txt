The program 2 processing assignment is purposed to conduct searches on the provided district website.
This program analyzes key words provided by the user and responds with appropriate Information.
The user inputs are not case sensitive and search for if the request contains key words.
Since .contains is used, the user may as a question naturally as a long string and the program will evaluate what response should be taken.
For instance if the user asked "What is his name". The word 'name' is flagged by the program and evaluated specifically for that rather than addressing the whole string.
This allows for faster processing of user input.
The district website is downloaded as soon as the user runs the program. This allows up to date information upon every execution.
